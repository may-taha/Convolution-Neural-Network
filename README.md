# Convolution Networks Workshop for the Montpellier bioinformatics team (MBI)

This Github was made for a Workshop about Artificial Network in general and more specifically, about convolution network
in theory and in practice.

# Elements for theory: 

1- A pdf with two presentations: The first presentation to explain the basics of Artificial and convolution networks, the theory, the input possible data, and the hyperparameters. 
The second presentation is a summary of the Keras package in python used to build and train convolution networks. 
   
2- A pdf of my Ph.D. report where from page 39 to page 58, I explain in theory (mathematical) Artificial Networks. 
   As well as in chapter 4, the application of convolution networks in DNA sequences. 
  
# Elements for practice in python:

1- A file for needed installation. 

2- An example of convolution networks for text (1 dimensional) 

3- An example of convolution network for images (2 dimensional)
